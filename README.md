# Datamining_Lab1

This lab is an introduction to datamining and machine learning using **Weka and Python (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib)**

During this lab I used:
  Supervised learning methods:
    - K nearest neighbors (python & weka)
    - Decision tree (python & weka)
  Unsupervised learning methods:
    - k means (weka)
  Pattern mining methods:
    - FP-growth algorithm (weka)
    - A-priori algorithm (python & weka)
  Evaluation methods: 
    - confusion matrix (python & weka)
    - cross-validation (weka)
